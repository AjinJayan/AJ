Automatic opening the door and turning off lights during morning 
And automatic closing door and turning off lights during night
The time can be controlled using an Real Time Clock (RTC DS1302)
Along with this,we can control the lights and door according to our wish(i.e.we can turn on/off light and close/open the door at any time using) using our MOBILE  which is connected to a bluetooth module
For this we need to install ARDUINO BLUETOOTH CONTROL which is avaliable in playstore,through which we are passing character values like '1','2','3','4' for different function

MATERIALS USED:

>ARDUINO UNO
>RELAY
>HC-05
>AC SOURCE

>LAMP
>RTC MODULE(DS1302)

PROTEUS STUMILATION is attached along with this in which the you can see the working of this project expect the bluetooth module part.
